# Add Telegram Channel

Add Telegram support to OpenClaw via a Telegram Bot.

## Prerequisites
OpenClaw must be installed (`openclaw --version` should work).

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

Tell the user to create a bot via BotFather:

> 1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
> 2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
> 3. Choose a display name (e.g., "My AI Assistant")
> 4. Choose a username ending in "bot" (e.g., "my_ai_assistant_bot")
> 5. Copy the bot token — looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`

Use WAIT_FOR_USER — the user does this in Telegram.

## Step 2: Configure the Bot Token

Collect the bot token via `secure_input` (secret_name: "telegram_bot_token").

Enable the channel, then store the token via the env reference (see below) so the token
never appears in a shell argument:
```bash
openclaw config set channels.telegram.enabled true
openclaw config set channels.telegram.botToken '${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}'
```
Single quotes are required — double quotes would let the shell expand the variable and
write the plaintext token into `openclaw.json`.

Or write directly to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}",
      enabled: true,
      dmPolicy: "pairing"  // approve first message from each user
    }
  }
}
```

And store the token. Do **not** run `openclaw config set env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN "<token>"` —
that puts the token in shell history and in the process table, and leaves it in plaintext
inside `openclaw.json`. Use `write_secret` instead:
- secret_name: `telegram_bot_token`
- file_path: expansion of `~/.openclaw/.env`
- format: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN={{value}}` (append, keep the trailing newline)

`write_secret` must establish restrictive permissions before writing: mode `0600` on
macOS/Linux, and an ACL for the current user plus LocalSystem on Windows. On macOS/Linux,
run `chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/.env` afterward only as a verification/fix-up. On Windows, do
not run `chmod`; use locale-independent well-known SIDs with the host's ACL tool:
```powershell
$me = ([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).User.Value
icacls.exe "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\.env" /inheritance:r /grant:r "*${me}:(F)" "*S-1-5-18:(F)"
```
The `*` prefix tells `icacls` to parse the values as SIDs instead of localized account
names. If the host cannot create or update the file with these permissions before the
secret bytes are written, stop rather than creating a default-permission file.
The `"${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}"` reference above resolves from that file — see
`playbook-setup-openclaw-config-reference.md` for the resolution order. If the token
leaks, revoke it with `/revoke` in BotFather and repeat this step.

## Step 3: Set Access Policy

Ask the user who should be allowed to message the bot:

- **Pairing mode** (default, recommended): First message from any user requires
  approval. Good for personal use.
- **Allowlist**: Only specific Telegram user IDs can interact.
- **Open**: Anyone can message (use with caution).

For allowlist, the user needs their Telegram numeric user ID. They can get it
from `@userinfobot` on Telegram.

## Step 4: Restart and Test

Restart the gateway to pick up channel changes:
```
openclaw gateway restart
```

Verify: `openclaw channels status --probe`

Have the user send a message to their bot on Telegram. If using pairing mode,
approve the pairing request when prompted.

## Step 5: Optional — Group Setup

If the user wants the bot in a group:

1. Disable group privacy in BotFather:
   > Send `/mybots` → select bot → Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn OFF

2. Add the bot to the Telegram group.

3. Configure group policy:
   ```
   openclaw config set channels.telegram.groupPolicy "open"
   ```
   Or use "allowlist" with specific sender IDs.

By default, the bot requires an @mention in groups.
