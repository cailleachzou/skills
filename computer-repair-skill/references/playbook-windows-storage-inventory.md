# Windows Storage Inventory

## When to activate
Use when a Windows volume is unexpectedly full, an unfamiliar directory is large, or the user wants a map of storage before deciding what to remove.

### 相邻流程：存储与迁移集群

「C 盘满了」会同时命中下面六个流程。先确认用户的真实诉求，命中错了就改路由，不要在本流程里硬做别的流程的事：

- 只想知道空间被谁占了（只读盘点） → [windows-storage-inventory](playbook-windows-storage-inventory.md) ← **本流程**
- 确认是缓存或重复文件 → [windows-application-cleanup](playbook-windows-application-cleanup.md)
- 要把应用或数据挪到别的盘 → [windows-application-migration](playbook-windows-application-migration.md)
- 迁移后出现幽灵链接或要回滚 → [windows-migration-history-recovery](playbook-windows-migration-history-recovery.md)
- 只想安全释放系统盘，不动应用 → [windows-disk-space-recovery](playbook-windows-disk-space-recovery.md)
- 空间确实不够，要动分区（风险最高） → [windows-partition-resize-audit](playbook-windows-partition-resize-audit.md)

## Quick check
Record the target volume, exact free/total bytes, Windows build, current user, and whether OneDrive, WSL, Docker, VMs, or backup software is active. Do not infer ownership from size alone.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 1. Measure narrow scopes
Use `win_disk_usage` for fixed volumes, then `win_path_inventory` on the volume root and one level at a time. Use literal paths, a time budget, and a maximum depth. Do not follow junctions or reparse points into another volume or user profile.

For each candidate record:

- absolute path, volume, owner and application (if known);
- bytes, item count, file-type distribution, newest/oldest modification time;
- whether it is synchronized, backed up, regenerable, or unknown;
- the evidence source and timestamp.

### 2. Classify before explaining
Classify each path as `protected-user-data`, `application-state`, `regenerable-cache`, `system-managed`, or `unknown`. Keep Documents, Downloads, mail, browser profiles, credentials, chat databases, media, cloud roots, VM disks and game libraries in the protected or unknown class until the user identifies them.

Cloud-storage clients, backup products and some security tools publish a virtual drive letter or mount point that is not local storage. Report the drive letter, provider and mount evidence read-only; do not include it in a volume free-space calculation, do not scan it for large files, and never target it for cleanup, migration or drive-letter changes. Removing the client's device or letter is the vendor's operation, not a storage fix.

If the user asks for an AI explanation, send only de-identified metadata: path labels, byte totals, counts, extension percentages and at most 20 relative path samples. Never send file contents, secrets, database rows, cookies or private keys.

### 3. Produce a decision report
Present the largest paths with a confidence level, likely owner, regeneration path, last-use evidence and a proposed next check. A large directory is an observation, not a deletion target. Route known applications to `windows-application-cleanup` rather than inventing a glob.

### 4. Plan any cleanup separately
For every proposed target list the exact child paths, expected recovery, application-close requirement, backup/quarantine location and rollback. Read [safety-policy.md](safety-policy.md) before changing anything.

## Verification
Re-run the same inventory and compare exact free bytes and the affected category. Confirm that synchronized folders, applications and the original low-space workflow still work. Inventory-only runs should leave a hashable report and no state change.

## Escalation
Escalate unexplained growth under Windows, Program Files, System Volume Information, recovery partitions, cloud roots, or a volume showing filesystem errors. Stop when a scan would require broad administrator access or would cross a reparse point.
