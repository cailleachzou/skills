# Windows WinRE System Repair

## When to activate
Use for repeated startup repair, system-file corruption, update-related boot failures, safe-mode requests, damaged Windows components or a machine that cannot reach the desktop reliably.

## Quick check
Record the exact stop code or symptom, last successful boot, pending restart/update, disk free space and health, BitLocker status, recovery-key availability, recent driver/software changes, backup status and whether WinRE is enabled. Preserve event and minidump metadata before deleting logs.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 1. Establish a non-destructive baseline
Use Event Viewer or `Get-WinEvent`, `sfc /verifyonly` where appropriate, `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth`, `chkdsk <volume> /scan`, and the existing recovery status. Do not treat a successful command exit as proof that the user's workflow is fixed.

### 2. Use the recovery ladder
Move from least to most disruptive:

1. Complete a pending restart and test the original workflow.
2. Boot Safe Mode or perform a clean diagnostic boot to separate third-party drivers and startup items.
3. Use WinRE Startup Repair or a verified restore point when the cause and rollback point are clear.
4. Repair online components with `sfc /scannow` and `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`, using an approved source if Windows Update is unavailable.
5. For an offline image, identify the actual Windows and EFI drive letters in WinRE before using offline paths.

### 3. Keep destructive actions separate
Do not run `bootrec`, `bcdboot`, `chkdsk /f`, `chkdsk /r`, reset-this-PC, format, repartition, registry replacement or reinstall as an automatic next step. These need a backup/recovery plan, exact target and explicit confirmation. If recovery is important, image first and route to `windows-data-recovery-triage`.

### 4. Verify one hypothesis at a time
After each approved action, reboot only when required, record the new error or success, and compare the affected service, driver or update state. Stop if the issue changes from system corruption to disk, firmware, encryption or hardware evidence.

## Verification
Repeat the original failing operation, inspect system-file and component health, confirm WinRE and BitLocker state, check pending updates, and verify that user data, applications and security controls remain intact.

## Caveats
- WinRE drive letters differ from normal Windows; never assume `C:` is the installed system.
- SFC and DISM can repair component files without fixing a bad driver, firmware problem or failing disk.
- Restore points and previous installations are recovery assets; do not delete them while the incident is unresolved.

## Escalation
Escalate repeated repair loops, disk errors, ransomware or malware evidence, encrypted enterprise volumes, missing recovery media, inaccessible recovery keys, and requests for boot-record or partition surgery.
