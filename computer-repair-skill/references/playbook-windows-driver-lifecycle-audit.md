# Windows Driver Lifecycle Audit

## When to activate
Use when a Windows device has a yellow warning icon, disappeared after an update, cannot connect, has broken audio/video, or requires an old USB, printer, serial or vendor-specific driver.

## Quick check
Record Windows edition/build and architecture, device name and class, problem time, current driver provider/version/date, device status, hardware IDs, signature status, recent Windows or BIOS changes, and whether a restore point or working driver package exists. Do not install a driver merely because the display name looks similar.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 1. Identify the device and source
Inspect Device Manager metadata and the `Hardware Ids` property. For unknown USB devices, use VID/PID to locate the manufacturer, then use the device or computer manufacturer's official support page. Prefer the exact model, OS build and architecture; record URL, version, publisher and hash when available.

### 2. Preserve the baseline
Capture the current driver metadata and a read-only PnP driver inventory. Check whether the device works in a second approved environment, such as Safe Mode or a trusted live system, before blaming hardware. Keep a known-good package outside the device's installation directory.

### 3. Use the least disruptive order
When the device is present but malfunctioning, propose these in order:

1. Reinstall the same known-good version.
2. Roll back to the previous version if the problem followed an update.
3. Install a newer official vendor version only after checking compatibility.
4. Remove the device and its package only as a separately approved last resort, with a recovery package ready.

Do not use bundled driver packs or search-engine downloads as the default. A newer driver is not automatically better for an old chip.

### 4. Handle legacy packages carefully
Check x86 versus x64 and supported Windows versions. If an old installer cannot detect the device, inspect the extracted package for a signed `.inf` and `.cat`; do not run an unknown self-extractor blindly. An administrator may use Device Manager's `Have Disk` flow or an explicitly approved `pnputil` action after the package and target hardware match.

### 5. Change one variable
Apply one driver change at a time, record the exit code and pending reboot, then re-enumerate the device. Stop on an unsigned package, an ambiguous match, a failed install, or a request to disable signature enforcement.

## Verification
Confirm the device status is healthy, the exact driver version/provider is expected, the original application or network workflow works, and no unrelated adapters, audio endpoints or startup services changed. Keep before/after driver metadata and the package hash.

## Caveats
- Windows Update may replace a vendor driver later; record the update channel and policy owner.
- A device with no warning icon can still be unusable because of a stopped vendor service, an incompatible application, a disabled physical switch or an obsolete chip.
- Driver installation can require elevation, network access or a restart. Do not leave a temporary administrator session running.

## Escalation
Escalate unsigned drivers, firmware or BIOS packages, kernel crashes, security software drivers, unknown hardware with no trustworthy vendor, repeated install failures, or a request to bypass signature enforcement.
