# Windows Hardware Maintenance Safety

## When to activate
Use before opening a Windows laptop, replacing storage, memory, wireless cards, battery or display parts, cleaning dust, or renewing thermal compound.

## Quick check
Identify the exact model and maintenance manual, warranty state, requested part, observed symptom, current hardware inventory, BitLocker status and backup. Confirm the device is not under power, charging or synchronization activity. Do not assume two visually similar models share screw locations or battery procedures.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 1. Confirm that physical work is justified
Collect temperature, fan, performance and device-health evidence first. For dust work, require a sustained thermal or airflow symptom rather than noise alone. For a replacement, verify the part is compatible, user data is backed up and the current part is not merely disabled in software.

### 2. Prepare safely
Use the official service manual. Shut down, unplug AC and peripherals, isolate the internal or removable battery using the model's documented method, and discharge residual power. Use ESD precautions and keep screws mapped by location. Some models expose a BIOS battery-safe mode; use it only when documented for that model.

### 3. Work within the boundary
Limit the teardown to the required component. Do not bend heat pipes, press on a display panel, pull antenna connectors by their wires, scrape a chip with metal, or force a glued battery. Board-level soldering, swollen batteries, liquid damage and unfamiliar display assemblies are outside routine self-service.

### 4. Handle thermal work deliberately
Clean fan blades, heatsink fins and the fin-to-fan interface. Use a suitable non-conductive tool for old compound, apply the vendor-appropriate amount, seat the heatsink once, and tighten numbered screws in a cross pattern without over-torquing. Reconnect every cable before closing.

### 5. Test before final closure
With the owner informed, perform a short power-on, device enumeration, charging, fan, temperature and display test. If the device fails, power down and inspect connectors before repeating the teardown. Do not use repeated forced starts on a machine with an encryption or storage warning.

## Verification
Confirm the replaced part matches the inventory, all connectors and fasteners are accounted for, the system boots, BitLocker protection is understood, the original symptom improves under a comparable load, and no new device, thermal, battery or display fault appears.

## Caveats
- A teardown can affect warranty, seals and return evidence.
- A fan noise complaint may be normal for the model; temperature and performance are stronger evidence.
- Battery swelling, burnt smell, liquid residue or a damaged connector requires stop-work and professional service.

## Escalation
Escalate board-level faults, swollen or punctured batteries, liquid damage, firmware or TPM issues, inaccessible battery isolation, missing service documentation, warranty-sensitive devices and any request to continue after a safety stop.
