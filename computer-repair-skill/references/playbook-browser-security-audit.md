# Browser Security Audit

Checks installed browsers for security issues: suspicious extensions, saved passwords, auto-update status, and tampered default search engines. Focuses on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## When to activate
Routine security review, post-phishing incident, user reports browser behaving strangely, adware/toolbar complaints, or new device onboarding.

## Standard check path

### 1. List installed browser extensions
Check each installed browser for extensions:
- **Chrome**: Read `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/` (macOS) or equivalent. Cross-reference extension IDs with the Chrome Web Store for names.
- **Firefox**: Read `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/extensions.json` (macOS) or equivalent.
- **Edge**: Read `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/Default/Extensions/` (macOS) or equivalent.

List all extensions with their names and whether they're from the official store.

### 2. Flag suspicious extensions
Flag extensions that match any of these patterns:
- Not from the official browser store (sideloaded).
- Request broad permissions (access to all sites, read/modify all data).
- Unknown or very low user count.
- Known adware/spyware extension names (Hola VPN, various "coupon" or "shopping assistant" extensions, PDF converters with excessive permissions).
- Extensions the user doesn't recognize.

Present findings and let the user decide what to remove.

### 3. Check for saved passwords in browsers
Count the entries — do not infer from file size. `Login Data` is a SQLite database with a
fixed schema, so it is several kilobytes even with zero saved passwords, and "file exists
and is nonzero" always reports true.

- **Chrome**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Login Data`. Chrome holds
  a lock on the live file, so copy it first and query a unique temporary copy:
  ```bash
  login_db="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Login Data"
  if ! query_db=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/computer-repair-login-data.XXXXXX"); then
    echo "Could not create a temporary database copy" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  cleanup() { rm -f "$query_db"; }
  trap cleanup EXIT HUP INT TERM
  if ! cp "$login_db" "$query_db"; then
    echo "Could not copy Login Data; count is unknown" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  sqlite3 "$query_db" "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM logins;"
  ```
  The `trap` removes only the file created by this run, including on failure. This
  returns a count only. Never select `password_value` — read no credential material.
- **Firefox**: `logins.json` in the Firefox profile. It is JSON; count the `logins` array
  length rather than checking existence, because the file is created empty.
- **Edge**: use the same unique-copy method, under `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/Default/Login Data`.

If `sqlite3` is unavailable, say the count could not be determined rather than guessing
from file size.

If saved passwords are found, warn the user: browser password storage is less secure than a dedicated password manager. Recommend migrating to 1Password, Bitwarden, or similar. Don't be preachy — just note the finding and the recommendation.

### 4. Check browser auto-update status
- **Chrome**: Check `com.google.Keystone` launch agent exists and is loaded (macOS). Chrome self-updates via Keystone.
- **Firefox**: Check Preferences → General → Updates setting (or `prefs.js` for `app.update.enabled`).
- **Edge**: Similar to Chrome, uses a Microsoft update agent.

Flag if auto-updates are disabled. Browsers are a primary attack vector — keeping them current is critical.

### 5. Check default search engine
- **Chrome**: Check `Preferences` JSON file for `default_search_provider_data`.
- **Firefox**: Check `prefs.js` for `browser.urlbar.placeholderName` or search configuration.
- **Edge**: Check Preferences file.

Flag if the default search engine has been changed to something unusual (not Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Yahoo). Adware commonly changes the search engine to ad-supported alternatives.

## Caveats
- Browser profile paths vary by OS. The paths above are macOS — adjust for Windows (`%APPDATA%`) and Linux (`~/.config/`).
- Don't dump or display actual saved passwords — just report that they exist and how many.
- Some enterprise environments manage extensions via policy. Policy-installed extensions are expected and shouldn't be flagged.
- Multiple browser profiles (personal/work) each have their own extensions and settings. Check all profiles.

> Steps 1-5 catch ~85% of browser-level security issues. Most common finding: suspicious or unused extensions.

## Key signals
- **"I keep getting redirected to weird sites"** → search engine hijack (step 5) or malicious extension (step 2).
- **"Toolbars appeared that I didn't install"** → adware extensions. Focus on step 2.
- **"Browser asks me to save passwords"** → step 3, recommend a dedicated password manager.
- **"I got a phishing email and clicked a link"** → check for newly installed extensions and changed settings.

## Escalation
If sideloaded extensions with broad permissions are found and the user didn't install them:
- Document the extension IDs and permissions — do not just remove them, as they may be evidence.
- Recommend a full endpoint security check (activate the `endpoint-security-check` playbook).
- If on a corporate device, notify IT — policy-managed extensions should come from a known source.

## Tools referenced
- Shell commands — read browser config files, check update agents
- Disk audit tools — check browser profile sizes
