# Windows Disk Space Recovery

## When to activate
User reports a full Windows drive, low-space warnings, update failures caused by storage, or asks to reclaim space without losing personal data.

### 相邻流程：存储与迁移集群

「C 盘满了」会同时命中下面六个流程。先确认用户的真实诉求，命中错了就改路由，不要在本流程里硬做别的流程的事：

- 只想知道空间被谁占了（只读盘点） → [windows-storage-inventory](playbook-windows-storage-inventory.md)
- 确认是缓存或重复文件 → [windows-application-cleanup](playbook-windows-application-cleanup.md)
- 要把应用或数据挪到别的盘 → [windows-application-migration](playbook-windows-application-migration.md)
- 迁移后出现幽灵链接或要回滚 → [windows-migration-history-recovery](playbook-windows-migration-history-recovery.md)
- 只想安全释放系统盘，不动应用 → [windows-disk-space-recovery](playbook-windows-disk-space-recovery.md) ← **本流程**
- 空间确实不够，要动分区（风险最高） → [windows-partition-resize-audit](playbook-windows-partition-resize-audit.md)

完整分流表见 [playbook-index.md](playbook-index.md)。

## Quick check
Run `win_disk_usage` and record total/free space for each fixed volume. Confirm the target volume and requested free-space goal.

Use [cleanup-protocol.md](cleanup-protocol.md): disk recovery is `inventory` and `analyze/preview` before any `apply`. Never treat a cleaner's silent mode or a saved selection as approval.

Do not begin deletion from a drive-level percentage alone. Measure categories first.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 0. Preserve data and classify the request
Separate “free space”, “move data”, “resize a partition” and “delete data” as different goals. If a move or resize is being considered, route to `windows-partition-resize-audit` before cleaning. Use 3-2-1 as the target for important files; a USB drive is not a sufficient sole backup.

### 1. Establish the baseline
Query `Win32_LogicalDisk` for fixed volumes. Record bytes, not only rounded GB. Check whether the low-space volume contains Windows, user profiles, applications, VMs, containers, or synchronized folders.

### 2. Measure top-level categories
Measure specific directories one level at a time. Start with user-approved roots such as the affected profile, `C:\ProgramData`, application caches, package caches, VM images, and container data.

Use PowerShell enumeration with a narrow literal path. Set a time budget; recursive scans of the full system drive can be slow and permission-limited.

Do not follow reparse points blindly. Treat OneDrive and other synchronized roots as user data.

### 3. Inspect Windows-managed storage
Check Settings storage categories or approved system tools. Analyze the component store before proposing cleanup:
```
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore
```

Inspect Windows Update download cache, Delivery Optimization, Recycle Bin, crash dumps, temporary files, hibernation, restore points, and old Windows installations as separate categories. Each has different recovery and rollback implications.

### 4. Inspect application and development data
Common large but intentional locations include IDE caches, package managers, Docker/WSL virtual disks, game libraries, browser profiles, Outlook data, VM images, and build artifacts.

Identify owner, last use, regeneration path, and whether the data is synchronized or backed up. A large directory is evidence, not permission to remove it.

### 5. Propose a tiered cleanup
Show exact measured targets and expected recovery:
1. Recycle Bin and confirmed temporary artifacts.
2. Application caches known to regenerate, after closing the application.
3. Package/download caches through their native package manager.
4. Windows-managed cleanup through Settings or supported commands.
5. User-selected archives, VMs, installers, or media moved to verified storage.

Keep user files, mail stores, browser profiles, credentials, cloud roots, and unknown application data out of automatic cleanup.

For every tier, produce a fixed target manifest with exact paths, measured bytes, owner, rule/source, exclusion checks, backup or quarantine destination, and rollback. Re-check size, hash and application state immediately before each approved action.

### 6. Execute with checkpoints
Obtain approval for the listed targets. Before each delete, follow `safety-policy.md`: inspect the literal path, enumerate concrete entries, and record recovery.

For offload requests, copy to the target, compare size/file count or hashes, let the user confirm the copy, then propose local cleanup separately.

## Verification
Re-run `win_disk_usage` and report exact before/after free bytes. Verify Windows Update or the original blocked workflow, plus the applications whose caches were touched.

Re-run the same inventory and cleanup rules, report residual/locked items, and keep the batch manifest readable. A successful command without a post-clean scan is not a successful recovery.

## Caveats
- Hibernation, restore points, component-store cleanup, and previous Windows installations reduce rollback options.
- WSL and Docker virtual disks may not shrink when files inside are deleted.
- OneDrive Files On-Demand state must be understood before changing local availability.
- Antivirus and indexing can temporarily hold deleted files or increase IO during cleanup.

## Key signals
- Low free space plus update failure -> recover supported system headroom first.
- Large user profile -> measure categories; preserve personal and synchronized data.
- Large WSL/Docker data -> clean through the owning platform, then inspect compaction separately.
- Large `WinSxS` -> trust DISM analysis, not Explorer's apparent size.
- `Installer`, restore points, chat databases, synchronized roots and WSL virtual disks -> require an owner-specific plan; do not treat them as generic cache.

## Tools referenced
- `win_disk_usage`
- `win_app_data_ls`
- `win_clear_app_cache`
- `win_move_file`
- `shell_run`

## Escalation
Escalate unknown system growth, filesystem errors, repeated volume exhaustion, or failed storage hardware with exact path measurements, volume health evidence, and a current backup status.
