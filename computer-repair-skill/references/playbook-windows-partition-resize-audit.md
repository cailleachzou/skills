# Windows Partition Resize Audit

## When to activate
Use when the user wants to expand C:, shrink or move a data partition, merge free space, change a disk layout or prepare a disk for reinstall.

### 相邻流程：存储与迁移集群

「C 盘满了」会同时命中下面六个流程。先确认用户的真实诉求，命中错了就改路由，不要在本流程里硬做别的流程的事：

- 只想知道空间被谁占了（只读盘点） → [windows-storage-inventory](playbook-windows-storage-inventory.md)
- 确认是缓存或重复文件 → [windows-application-cleanup](playbook-windows-application-cleanup.md)
- 要把应用或数据挪到别的盘 → [windows-application-migration](playbook-windows-application-migration.md)
- 迁移后出现幽灵链接或要回滚 → [windows-migration-history-recovery](playbook-windows-migration-history-recovery.md)
- 只想安全释放系统盘，不动应用 → [windows-disk-space-recovery](playbook-windows-disk-space-recovery.md)
- 空间确实不够，要动分区（风险最高） → [windows-partition-resize-audit](playbook-windows-partition-resize-audit.md) ← **本流程**

完整分流表见 [playbook-index.md](playbook-index.md)。

## Quick check
Build a read-only map of physical disks, partition order, sizes, filesystem, free space, boot/recovery partitions, BitLocker state and mounted volumes. Record which filesystems and user data are on every partition that would move. Do not infer that free space at the end of D: is adjacent to C:.

## Standard diagnostic path

### 1. Establish recoverability
Back up important data from every partition that may move and verify the copy. For high-value or failing disks, make a verified image. Run `windows-bitlocker-recovery-triage` and ensure all relevant volumes have recovery keys; offline partition tools may not support encrypted NTFS layouts.

### 2. Determine whether the request is actually needed
Run `windows-storage-inventory` and `windows-disk-space-recovery` first. Remove only confirmed regenerable data or move verified archives if that solves the capacity problem. A small C: drive is not by itself a reason to repartition.

### 3. Check geometry and tool boundary
Windows Disk Management can extend into immediately adjacent unallocated space, but cannot safely move arbitrary intervening data. Moving a partition requires an offline environment and a reviewed tool — boot WinRE (Shift + Restart → Troubleshoot), a WinPE image, or the vendor's own bootable media. Do not plan around Windows To Go: it was deprecated in Windows 10 version 2004 and removed, so it is not available on any current system. Do not resize the running system volume with an unreviewed hot operation.

### 4. Produce a human-executed plan
List the exact disk, partitions, source of free space, expected new sizes, order of any moves, AC-power requirement, estimated downtime, backup location and rollback limitation. When multiple partitions are crossed, the plan must move them from the farthest affected partition toward C: and must stop if any partition is dynamic, encrypted, failing or unknown.

### 5. Keep execution outside automatic repair
The host Agent may collect the map and verify results, but must not invoke `Resize-Partition`, DiskGenius, GParted, format, delete-partition or a PE imaging tool without a separate explicit authorization and technician-controlled session. Never resize a disk whose only backup is on a partition being moved.

## Verification
After the technician reports completion, re-read the partition table, volume sizes, filesystem health, drive letters, BitLocker state and boot entries. Compare file counts or hashes for affected data and run the original low-space workflow. Do not delete the old backup until the user confirms the result.

## Caveats
- Power loss or a crashed partition tool during data movement can make an entire volume inaccessible.
- SSD free space and filesystem free space are different; shrinking a partition does not create a backup.
- Recovery and EFI partitions are not ordinary data volumes and must not be merged or deleted casually.

## Escalation
Escalate missing backups, BitLocker key gaps, dynamic or vendor-managed disks, filesystem errors, SMART warnings, multiple-disk ambiguity, boot/recovery partition changes and any request to erase data.
